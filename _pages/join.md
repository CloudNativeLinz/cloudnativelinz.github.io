This community is all about people 👨‍💻👩‍💻, although we ❤️ cloud-native technologies!

We usually meet on the third or forth Tuesday of the month somewhere in Linz. 

As we use the following online platform to organize our meetups, please join them to stay up-to-date with upcoming events!

- Our official home as a chapter in the CNCF is on the CNCF community page. 
- For broader reach, we also have a meetup.com page which we are planning to retire soon. You are welcome to join here as well, but please consider the CNCF.io page as the first choice.
