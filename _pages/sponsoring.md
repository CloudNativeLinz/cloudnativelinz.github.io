We are running our meetup in our spare time and we don't get paid for doing this. Therefore, we rely on sponsors or event hosts to be able to meet, network, and enjoy talks together. If you want to sponsor us (or host us in your offices) you'll find more information here. We are also sharing statistics on participants that might help you justify your investment. Thanks for supporting the Cloud Native Linz community!
