Juliano Costa is a software engineer/developer advocate born and raised in Brazil who loves learning new things. In the last couple of years he has put his efforts into cloud technologies and got super excited about it, which made him start a Cloud Native Community Group together with a colleague in Linz (Austria), where he lives now. Besides that he is also a maintainer of the [OpenTelemetry Demo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo). When he is not working with k8s and OpenTelemetry, he is probably spending some time with his wife and his newly deployed baby.
