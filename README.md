## Development using Codespaces

It is easiest to use codespaces since all tooling is already installed in the dev-container.

Open via the Github UI and once you have launched the codespaces, run a development session via:

```
jekyll serve
```
or via auto reload in the browser
```
jekyll serve --livereload
```
