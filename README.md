## Development using Codespaces

It is easiest to use codespaces since all tooling is already installed in the dev-container.

Open via the Github UI and once you have launched the codespaces, run a development session via:

```
jekyll serve
```
or via auto reload in the browser
```
jekyll serve --livereload
```

The preview is now available via http://127.0.0.1:4000/

## Local development without Codespaces

Probably there are some dependencies that you'd need to check to run the static web generator Jekyll locally. If you want to contribute to this readme to fill in the blanks here, you are most welcome!
